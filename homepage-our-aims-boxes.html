    <p>For many of us, one of the great joys in life is the ability to explore the wilderness. This could be a short trek in the local National Park or a longer expedition in one of the world’s wilderness areas.</p>
    <p>Either way, it is something that is not generally open to those whose mobility is constrained.</p>
    <p>Our aim is to build a power assisted handcycle that will enable mobility impaired people to access, explore and enjoy our National Parks and the wilderness areas of our planet on a fully independent basis.</p>
    <p>The handcycle will be tested in an expedition involving two multiple amputees to ascend Ras Dashen, the tallest mountain in Ethiopia.</p>

    <p>In many areas of the world, disabled people, particularly amputees, can struggle to play a useful and active role in their communities. This is particularly the case in lower Income countries where imported wheelchairs are expensive and out of the reach of all but a few.</p>
    <p>In association with the charity Laureus Sport for Good, we are using our project and expedition to finance the establishment of a sports wheelchair manufacturing facility in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia and support ongoing Laureus programmes in the region. The funds raised should be sufficient to enable local production of at least 200 wheelchairs.</p>
